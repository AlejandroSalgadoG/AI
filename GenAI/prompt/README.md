# DSPy examples

1. Basic QA
2. CoT
3. Typed predictors
4. RAG

These examples are based on Complete DSPy Tutorial by Neural Breakdown with AVB

## Motivation

Pormpt engineering may have the following problems

* Prompt might change due to LLM Change
* Depends on previous modules to work correctly
* Manual supervision required
* New llm may not need overtuned prompts

DSPy is a framework to address some of these problems by creating a way to optimize llm prompts algorithmically
